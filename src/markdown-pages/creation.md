### The initialization of the blog.

Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a particular individual or company.

Here is a description of this type of website from wikipedia on [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog): 

> A blog is a discussion or informational website published
> on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal
> diary-style text entries. Posts are typically displayed in
> reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post
> appears first, at the top of the web page.
