Original Statement:
This video is not meant to showcase "amazing" skateboarding. It's purpose is to record the progression of us (the people in the video) as skaters. This will be a yearly video and hopefully the video gets better and longer as the years pass! Hope you enjoy(ed) it

Looking back:
It was pretty obvious the quality varied across filming, editing, and skating. The plan was to make a new video every year, but as time progressed the crew grew apart and half of the skaters quit skateboarding.
